</div>

## Setup

1. Follow the instructions in [create-discord-bot](https://github.com/peterthehan/create-discord-bot).

> Don't forget to give your bot the `Manage Roles` permission!

2. Download this widget and move it into the [src/widgets](https://github.com/peterthehan/create-discord-bot/blob/master/src/widgets/) folder.

3. Open [config.js](https://github.com/peterthehan/discord-reaction-role-bot/blob/master/config.js) to configure your own settings:

```js
rules: {
  'MESSAGE_ID': {
    channelId: 'CHANNEL_ID',
    isUnique: true,
    emojiRoleMap: {
      'EMOJI_1': ['ROLE_1_ID'],
      'EMOJI_2': ['ROLE_2_ID'],
      'EMOJI_3': ['ROLE_3_ID', 'ROLE_4_ID'],
      // ...Add as many emoji-role mappings as you want.
    }
  },
  // ...Add as many rules as you want.
}
```

> If `isUnique` is `true`, the user can select only one role group at a time (gif above).

> If `isUnique` is `false`, the user can select as many role groups as they want.

> `EMOJI` can be the unicode value for default emojis or the emoji id for custom emojis.

> An emoji can map to multiple roles as seen in `EMOJI_3` above.
